This folder contains the files corresponding to the case studies presented in my PhD manuscript.

The subfolder *chap3* contains the Tamarin files for the case studies presented in Chapter 3 and some additional material corresponding to:
* encodings of unlinkability using diff-equivalence for the Basic Hash protocol;
* experiments with GSVerif on a simplified version of the LAK protocol;
* experiments with Tamarin and the XOR operator.

The subfolder *chap4* contains the Squirrel files for the case studies presented in Chapter 4.
